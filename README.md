## Introduction

Sink-a-Ship is a basic console game where the player attempts to sink three ships hidden on a 7x7 grid. The player inputs guesses in the form of grid coordinates (e.g., `a1`, `g7`) and the game provides feedback on whether the guess was a hit, miss, or resulted in sinking a ship.

## Game Rules

1. There are three ships, each occupying three consecutive cells either horizontally or vertically.
2. The player inputs guesses to hit the ships.
3. The game ends when all ships are sunk.
4. The game displays the number of attempts the player made to sink all ships.

## How to Play

1. After starting the game, you will be prompted to enter your guesses.
2. Input your guess in the format `[a1, g7]` and press Enter.
3. The game will inform you if your guess was a hit, miss, or if you sank a ship.
4. Continue guessing until all ships are sunk.
5. The game will display the total number of tries taken to sink all ships.
